# Digit-Recognition-with-Linear-Regression
Using Linear Regression to classify images from MNIST.csv

## Introduction 

Model proposes converting a csv file of MNIST numbers with labels and pixel values into a numpy array to classify and train using scikit learn's inbuilt logistic regression function. Model performance was evaluated using mean squared error and model.score for logistic regression.

## Technologies
All code was run in a google colaboratory notebook.

Python version 3.6
Tensorflow version 2.4.0
Pandas version 1.1.15
Keras version 2.4.3

Running this code requires using google colab with your dataset stored in the linked google drive.
